# Logging and Monitoring

## PHP Error Logging
- PHP errors are logged to `logs/php_errors.log`.
- Ensure that the log file is writable by the web server.

## Database Query Logging
- All executed queries and errors are logged in the PHP error log.
- This helps in tracking database interactions and identifying issues.

## JavaScript Error Logging
- JavaScript errors and AJAX call failures are logged to the console.
- Errors are also sent to the server for logging.

## Accessing Logs
- PHP error logs can be accessed at `logs/php_errors.log`.
- Monitor this file for any errors or issues that arise during application execution.

## Monitoring Tools
- Consider using monitoring tools or services to track application uptime and performance metrics.
- Ensure that logging does not expose sensitive information.

## Maintenance
- Regularly review logs to identify and resolve issues.
- Document any recurring issues and their resolutions for future reference.
